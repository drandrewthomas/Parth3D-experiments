# Exploring the horopter using Python 3

This is a repository for a Python 3 example of plotting stereoscopic disparity, and the circle known as the horopter. It is from a Parth3D blog post and you can access it at the link below:

The example disparity image created by the Python 3 code is shown below. However, it is anticipated that the code can be easily changed to allow for further investigation of stereo vision and 3D imaging/images.
