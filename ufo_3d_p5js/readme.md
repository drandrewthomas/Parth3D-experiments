# Interactive 3D models in a web page using P5.js

Here you find a code example from [Parth3D.co.uk](https://parth3d.co.uk/) that shows how to load OBJ 3D files saved by Blender in a web page using [P5.js](https://p5js.org). The example is interactive with a UFO that reacts to mouse clicking or touching.

[You can see the code running at Github.io in your web-browser by clicking here.](https://drandrewthomas.github.io/Parth3D-experiments/ufo_3d_p5js/)

The code here was provided in a Parth3D blog post which you can find at the following URL:

And here's a preview of what the code results in.
