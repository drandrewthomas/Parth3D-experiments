# Converting VR360 images and depth maps to OBJ files using Python 3

This is a repository for a Python 3 example of how to create spherical 3D models from 360-degree photos. It allows the sphere vertices to be adjusted using a depthmap image, which in the example here was created using Looking Glass Blocks. The adjusted sphjere is then saved to an OBJ file for importing into 3D software such as Blender. It is from a Parth3D blog post and you can access it at the link below:

The example disparity image created by the Python 3 code is shown below. However, it is anticipated that the code can be easily changed to allow for further investigation of stereo vision and 3D imaging/images.
