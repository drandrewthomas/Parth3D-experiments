# Creating 3D photo assets for Nomad Sculpt using Python 3

This is a simple piece of Python 3 code that can be used to create Wavefront OBJ and MTL files from images, so they can be mapped onto 3D cubes. They can then be imported into Nomad Sculpt as photo assets for adding to scenes for 3D rendering, or into other software such as Blender if you want to.

The code was written for a Parth3D blog post that you can read at the link below:

Below is an example screenshot showing a number of cube-mapped images trimmed and placed in Nomad Sculpt (note they are casting shadows onto each other as expected). Please note that the image of Brunel used in examples was taken at the [SS Great Britain in Bristol](https://www.ssgreatbritain.org) and a visit is highly recommended.
