# Nomad Sculpt side-by-side stereo rendering using Python 3

Here you find a code example from [Parth3D.co.uk](https://parth3d.co.uk/) that shows how to create stereoscopic renders of Nomad Sculpt scenes using Python 3. The code should work on Pythonista (iOS) and PyDroid3 (Android) allowing for the whole sculpting, rendering and compositing to stereo side-by-side images can be undertaken on the same device.

The code here was provided in a Parth3D blog post which you can find at the following URL:

And here's an example of the output: an anaglyph of part of Druids Circle in North Wales.
