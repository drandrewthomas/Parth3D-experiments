# Creating transparent backgrounds in Blender renders from a Python script

Here you find a code example from [Parth3D.co.uk](https://parth3d.co.uk/) that shows how to make the background of a Blender render transparent (for compositing and chroma-keying) from within a Python script.

The code here was provided in a Parth3D blog post which you can find at the following URL:

And here's a simple example of what the code offers.
